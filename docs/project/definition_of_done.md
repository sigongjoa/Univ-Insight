# Definition of Done (DoD)

For any task or feature in the **Univ-Insight** project to be considered "Complete," it must satisfy the following criteria. This ensures consistent quality and maintainability.

## 1. Code Quality
*   [ ] **Functionality:** The code performs the task as described in the User Story or Requirement.
*   [ ] **Style:** Follows PEP 8 guidelines (checked via `flake8` or `black`).
*   [ ] **No Hardcoding:** API keys, URLs, and magic numbers are extracted to configuration or constants.
*   [ ] **Type Hinting:** Python type hints are used for all function arguments and return values.

## 2. Testing (TDD)
*   [ ] **Unit Tests:** Tests exist for all core logic functions (Coverage > 80%).
*   [ ] **Pass:** All tests (new and existing) pass without errors.
*   [ ] **Mocking:** External services (OpenAI, Notion, Web Scraping) are mocked in unit tests.

## 3. Documentation
*   [ ] **Docstrings:** All public functions and classes have docstrings explaining inputs, outputs, and purpose.
*   [ ] **API Docs:** If an API endpoint was changed, the Swagger/OpenAPI documentation (auto-generated by FastAPI) is verified.
*   [ ] **Readme/Docs:** Any new setup steps or architecture changes are reflected in the `docs/` folder.

## 4. Architecture & Security
*   [ ] **Secrets:** No secrets (API Keys) are committed to Git.
*   [ ] **Error Handling:** Potential errors (Network, Parsing, API limits) are handled gracefully (try/except).

## 5. Verification
*   [ ] **Local Run:** The feature has been verified by running the application locally.
*   [ ] **Test Report:** A test report (HTML or CLI output) confirms the stability of the build.
